This package includes the module Text::FIGlet, several scripts which use it,
the FIGlet fonts standard.flf and mini.flf and documentation on creating fonts.

NAME
    Text::FIGlet - a perl module to provide FIGlet abilities, akin to banner

SYNOPSIS
     my $font = Text::FIGlet-E<gt>new(-f=>"doh");
     print scalar $font->figify(-A=>"Hello World");

DESCRIPTION

     But why?

     Because I could.

     But why?

     Because I like FIGlet and Perl.

     But why? In Bob's name WHY?! What purpose could it serve?

     If you want something more substantive imagine:
       * Run Apache with mod_perl
       * In F<startup.pl> create a Text::FIGlet object
         * figify text for the heads of Directory listings,
           and you look like a warm and fuzzy BBS
         * create ornate text based counters or timestamps on pages
         * {shudder} CAPTCHA bots
           NOTE: Ransom mode--unique to this implementation--may be handy here.

     Or not, I just make the scissors, now run along.

figlet.pl is a young adult and does not yet do smushing, among other things.

minifig.pl is a self-contained version of figlet.pl
It requires nothing more than a standard Perl distribution.
For more information about minifig.pl see minifig.pl -help,
and doc/minifig.HOWTO on customizing it.

% minifig.pl -A Hello World
