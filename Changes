Revision history for Perl extension Text::FIGlet, figlet.pl, minifig.pl
1.04  Thu Nov 30 01:37:57 GMT 2000
        - Decided to fix a bug where if you supplied -d and
	  an absolute path for -f, you got what you deserved.
	  But after eating my own dogfood; there is now a
	  Webmin module that uses this ;-) Tastes great!
	  Totally useless!; I found it was rather annoying.
	- Fixed -w, it is now much smarter and wraps whole words
	  where applicable en lieu of letters. It is still conceivable
	  that it the output may overrun the requested outputwidth.
	  If you run into this *LET ME KNOW* (text w/formatting, font),
	  please. So I can determine if it's worth opening that can of worms.
        - Seems I can't quite get this right...
	  I bumped the VERSION to 1.03 in minifig.pl but FIGlet.pm
	  was left at 1.02. Also neglected to increment the figlet.pl
	  VERSION. And I left the timestamp off of the 1.03 entry below.
	- Documented -help, added usage statement
	- Added smush mode
	  -F has been fixed and is now smush mode -0
