!!!	$^W isn't mutable at runtime in 5.005

FIX
?	charmap for widechar/TOIlet fonts

??	TOIlet permits widechars as EOL!

	charmapl.pl
		Text::Wrap in 5.6 is broken :-P so >0xff are wrapped

	Control
		literal needs to use $RE{UTFchar}
			$opts{-U} = 1 if /^\s*/
			$opts{-U} ? UTFchar : bytechar

		if pre 5.6 ignore char > 0xFF and use \x.. syntax?!
			switch to s alternation (for > 0xff)?

	XXX	cannot support unicode literals...?
			at all (#$#@, could translate to \x{} notation)

			just pre 5.6 (could translate to s///)
VRFY
	grep for XXX, "patches"

TEST
	-U=0, -U=-1

XXX	add test for DOS txt file font?

REFACTOR
	Switch to ::AnyInflate?

	Benchmark
		dprof

		$font alias again

        Negative Char performance
		 Pre-allocating length halves size of array,
		 req. scan file for - 1st, seek/read backwards? iff -U
		     (assumes sane file order, but is okay for optimization?)
		     Alas header[-1], codetag count, is useless here

		 Hash(collision performance hit)?

		 2nd array(code complexity?)?

	detect if glyph has been seen before, and reference it?

	reduce reliance upon $/
		ammend split expression?

        Native UTF8 in 5.8+?

	-m=-0
		a) keep current hack on hack
		b) use header width

		may break, depending on Text::Wrap?

		use header[3] as initial approximation of char width,
		to help nix up-to 0x7e heuristic

	header	http://www.jave.de/figlet/figfont.html#headerline
		 -2 = full layout
		 -1 = figchar count!! optimize file parser with this?

FEATURES
	- smushing

		means of enabling old big X mode? 16**2?

	  	Very difficult for non-rectangular fonts though...
	  	If at each character join, s/\000 /\000/ on copy happens HEIGHT times,
	  	swap that in and repeat until it doesn't? Or is kerning first enough?

	- "Vertical Fitting", indicated by header[-2] above

	- Ransom support for ANSI & Unicode (w/ sparse codepoints)

	- Ransom script to generate font, test output, then save font

        - QOTW19 "OCR"?

	- controls; h j b g
		- isn't u enough?

	- other scripts: chkfont--

XXX	- test 4, and 5005-lib.pm => test-lib.pm
	  remove bin/figlet.pl line from README
