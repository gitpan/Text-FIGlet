VRFY
	Test::Differences dependency?

	grep for XXX, "patches"

	bin tools versions

CAVEAT
	Negative char performance. Note about load time/memory hit?

	-m=-0
	a) keep current hack on hack
	b) use header width

	may break, depending on Text::Wrap?

charmapl.pl
	Text::Wrap in 5.6 is broken :-P so >0xff are wrapped

Refactor
	Benchmark
		$font alias again

		1.07 vs. 1.06

		dprof

        Negative Char performance
		 Hash(collision performance hit)?

		 2nd array(code complexity?)?

		 Pre-allocating length halves size of array,
		 req. scan file for - 1st, seek/read backwards? iff -U
		     (assumes sane file order, but is okay for optimization?)

	char =[] can get blank chars to not be ref's?!

	reduce reliance upon $/
		ammend split expression?

        Native UTF8 in 5.8+?

General
	- zipped font support?
	- smushing (-m=1|2|4|8|16|32)
	  TOIlet -o/verlap mode? (partial lamination of each FIGchar)
          Would have to know what chars are "inside" the top letter for opacity
	- controls; h j b g
		- isn't u enough?
	- "Vertical Fitting"?
	- other scripts: chkfont
	- Text::FIGlet::Mixed, for creating the anti-spambot style text
		- mixed({
			-f=>Text::FIGlet->new, #Font Object
			-A=>'H',               #Input
			pre=> CODREF,          #Control object, etc.
			post=>CODEREF,         #eg; y/x/*/
			} ... );
Control
	literal needs to use $RE{UTFchar}
		$opts{-U} = 1 if /^\s*/
		$opts{-U} ? UTFchar : bytechar

	if pre 5.6 ignore char > 0xFF and use \x.. syntax?!
		switch to an OR'd s (for > 0xff)?

	cannot support unicode literals...?
		at all (#$#@, could translate to \x{} notation)

		just pre 5.6 (could translate to s///)
