Revision history for Perl extension Text::FIGlet, figlet.pl, minifig.pl
1.06
	- Renamed Changes CHANGES
	- Touched up man pages, added (undocumented) support for
	   -h and --help to the scripts
	- Major cleanup, fixed many translucent bugs,
	  it's amazing if it was even "working" ;-)
	- Fixed a bug that failed on relative paths to fonts with -f
	- Added showfigfonts.pl utility,
	  it's exposes the slowness of loading fonts
	  (working on it, thangs wog and jryan)
	- Fixed extended character support,
	  subsequently reducing memory requirements (in a fashion)
	- Deprecated -demo, use the charmap.pl utility instead
	- Added $REVISION to figlet.pl and minifig.pl
	- Modified switch parsing in figlet.pl and minifig.pl,
	  perl -s is no longer used. Support for standard figlet switch
	  syntax was added so now you can say -m0 or -m=0 or -m 0.
	  Of course this means you can say things like -m-0 and -m -0
	  which may look a little odd.
	- Made figlet.pl and minifig.pl use strict
	- Fixed -w=1, I believe this was broken in 1.04 when I kludged
	  wrapping. I also did some work on wrapping in general and
	  there should be no more issues.

1.05  
	- Added -m modes 0 (kerning) and -2 (font defined)
	- Added -c, -l, -r, -x; justification
	- Added -L, -R, -X; orientation
	- Added -E
        - Fixed -f to allow absolute path
	- Documentation, had neglected to remove -F and other cleanup
	- Synced figlet.pl and minifig.pl
	- Updated minifig.HOWTO
	- Upgraded figlet.pl/minifig.pl version to 2.1,
	  I'm told this more appropriate based upon current
	  white-space handling in font files.
	- Switched internal font structure to an array.
	  I'd avoided using an array for fear of allocating large
	  blocks of memory due to auto-vivification. But this
	  shouldn't even be a potential problem unless you're using
	  a font that defines extended characters sparsely.
	  This change increases performance because it avoids
	  the permutations limiting factor of hashes, and is
	  proportional to the text size.
	  -f mini -m 0 -A Hello #Hash
	  1.800u 0.020s 0:01.81 100.5%    0+0k 0+0io 253pf+0w
	  -f mini -m 0 -A Hello #Array
	  1.250u 0.050s 0:01.29 100.7%    0+0k 0+0io 251pf+0w
	- Removed "- Better line wrapping" from TODO for 1.04.
	  Considered done until reported broken (See 1.04 below)

1.04  Thu Nov 30 01:37:57 GMT 2000
	- Decided to fix a bug where if you supplied -d and
	  an absolute path for -f, you got what you deserved.
	  But after eating my own dog food (there's a
	  Webmin module that uses this now... Tastes great!
	  Totally useless! :-), I found it was rather annoying.
	- Fixed -w, it is now much smarter and wraps whole words
	  where applicable en lieu of letters. It is still
	  conceivable that the output may overrun the requested
	  outputwidth. If you run into this *LET ME KNOW*
	  (text w/formatting, font), please. So I can determine
	  if it's worth opening that can of worms.
        - Seems I can't quite get this right...
	  I bumped the VERSION to 1.03 in minifig.pl but
	  FIGlet.pm was left at 1.02. Also neglected to increment
	  the figlet.pl VERSION. And I left the timestamp off of
	  the 1.03 entry below.
	- Documented -help, added usage statement
	- Added smush mode
	  -F has been fixed and is now smush mode -0

1.03  Sun Nov 12 20:07 GMT 2000
	- Version bumped to 1.03, 0.02 had $VERSION set to 1.02
	- Added minifig.pl, a self contained figlet
	- Added -help (it displays the builting pod)
	- Added missing URLs in FILES to figlet.pl
	- Added -D German support
	- Created -F, fixed width
	- Created -demo (figlet.pl/minifig.pl)
	- Cleaned and clarified pod
